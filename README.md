A replacement for "cd" that quotes XKCD

## Installation

Mashes a function at the end of your `.bash_profile`. If you keep your system tidy or don't have a one... figure it out

```shell
git clone https://github.com/adrianlyjak/xkcd
cd xkcd
./install.sh
```

## Usage
use just like `cd`

```shell
Desktop user-foo$ xkcd ~/Pictures
"'Big Data' doesn't just mean increasing the font size."
Pictures user-foo$

```
